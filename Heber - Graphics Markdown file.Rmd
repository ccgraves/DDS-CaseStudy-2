#Frequencies for Gender, Education, and Occupation
#For Gender:
ggplot(workforce.df) + aes(x = Gender)  + labs (title = "Comparative Numbers of Female and Male Employees") + geom_bar(fill = "#167DE6") + theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text (hjust = 0.5))
#For Education
ggplot(workforce.df) + aes(x = Education)  + labs (title = "Maximum Education Levels of Employees") + geom_bar(fill = "#992CC1") + theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text (hjust = 0.5))
#Another color for Education

#Job Role
ggplot(data.frame(workforce.df)) + aes(x=JobRole) + labs (title = "Work Force - Number per Position") + geom_bar(fill = "#CC79A7") + theme_bw() + theme(plot.title = element_text(angle=0,hjust=0.5,vjust=0.5)) + coord_flip()
#Count of Management Positions

##THIS NEXT PLOT IS FOR QUESTION 4. THE PLOT IN THE CURRENT DOCUMENT IS NOT CORRECT, AS IT PLOTS MONTHLY_RATE VERSUS AGE. THE QUESTION ASKS FOR MONTHLY_INCOME VERSUS AGE. THIS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, AND THE SUBSEQUENT TEXT THAT ANSWERS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.
